This repository contains algorithms and data structures implemented during my **Computer Science** coursework. The primary focus is understanding memory management, data manipulation logic, and algorithmic efficiency.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The implementations are organized by category:

### 1. Linear Structures
* **Arrays & Matrices:** Basic manipulation, traversing, and searching.
* **Linked Lists:** Singly and doubly linked lists; insertion, deletion, and node traversal.
* **Stacks:** Implementation of the **LIFO** (Last-In, First-Out) principle.
* **Queues:** Implementation of the **FIFO** (First-In, First-Out) principle.

### 2. Sorting Algorithms
* **Basic Sorts:** Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.
* **Advanced Sorts:** Quick Sort and Merge Sort (where applicable).

### 3. Non-Linear Structures (Upcoming / In Progress)
* **Binary Trees:** Tree traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order).
* **Hash Tables:** Handling collisions and key-value mapping.
* **Graphs:** Representation and basic search algorithms.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
* **Language:** Java
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🚀 How to Use
Each directory represents a specific topic or structure.
1. Navigate to the desired structure's folder.
2. Most classes include a `main` method to run quick tests and verify the algorithm's behavior in the console.
